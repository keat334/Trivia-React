# Trivia Game

React / Redux based Trivia game

Other technologies used:
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) as CSS framework (no custom CSS used)
- Scaffolding, build process etc. is handled by [Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)

## Remarks:

For simplicity application consumes [js objects](https://github.com/XOP/trivia-react/blob/master/src/reducers/questionsReducer.js) as resources (texts, data).  

In real project App should be a Component itself with everything provided as props, potentially with the config params.
